# 🌍 Biosphere Dashboard

**Biosphere Dashboard** is a one-window environmental monitoring app that visualizes Earth’s biosphere data — vegetation, atmosphere, temperature, and more — using interactive maps and real-time insights powered by open NASA and environmental APIs.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project is designed as a **single-window dashboard**, not a multi-page website.  
All map layers, widgets, and data feeds appear in one unified interface for simplicity and speed.

It’s ideal for:
- Environmental researchers and students  
- Climate and biosphere enthusiasts  
- Data visualization experiments  
- Integrations with machine learning and sustainability projects  

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map:** View biosphere data layers such as vegetation, cloud cover, and temperature.  
- 🌡️ **Live Updates:** Pulls real-time environmental and satellite data.  
- 📊 **Data Widgets:** Display analytics, graphs, and metrics in one window.  
- 🧬 **NASA & Open APIs:** Integrates with NASA EarthData, OpenWeather, or other sources.  
- 💻 **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and tablet.
